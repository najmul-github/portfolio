## Junior Design Project

> **Illegal Border Crossing Detection with Surveillance Camera:**
>
> *(JavaScript, Heroku Cloud, Java and C)*
>
> Illegal border crossing detection with surveillance cameras can
> improve privacy, safety and illegally crossing the border. These
> systems detect and localize the human and recognize the face of known
> and unknown people. Then information is sent to the server from the
> hardware device. In addition, this system will give feedback to the
> security monitor system. Human detection is known by object detection
> API. Using tensor flow object detection API, it detects humans. This
> device can easily monitor long borders without requiring any human
> assistance.
